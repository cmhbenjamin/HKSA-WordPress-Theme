# HKSA-WordPress-Theme
This is a wordpress I created for Hong Kong Student Association at University of Washington in 2013
http://students.washington.edu/hksa/
## Basic Structure
Using WordPress for the student organization’s website has the advantage of easy management for people
without web development background. It was designed with responsive web design approach to allow easy
navigation on all kind of device with different monitor size.
In order to have a consistence design across all the pages, I designed a few templete pages for the main
functionality of the site:
1. Front page
2. Normal pages for general description
3. Officer page shows a list of officers grouped by their position
4. Sponsors page shows a list of companies that support the organization
5. Event page
6. Navigation page for mobile browser
## Tasks
###Update description
descriptions includes about us, about hk, contact, event descriptions, join us…
1. from the menu select Pages
2. select page you want to edit

###update officers
###Change events
###Change Menu
###Update front page image

Important:
disable comments in all new page to avoid advertisement robots
